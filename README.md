# Algorithmic Accountability in Media: Delineating Political Bias through TFIDF and Logistic Regression

**Author**: Ji Noh - eun.ji.noh@vanderbilt.edu

This repository contains the code and dataset used in the research paper titled "Dissecting Political Orientation in Media Content Through TFIDF and NLP Techniques." The study investigates the application of Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TFIDF) analysis, coupled with logistic regression, to classify news articles into conservative or liberal categories based on their content.

## About the Research
In an era of polarized political discourse, understanding media bias is more critical than ever. This project applies machine learning and natural language processing to a large corpus of news articles to discern linguistic patterns that correlate with political biases. We leverage the TFIDF statistical measure to highlight the importance of words within articles and use logistic regression to classify these texts according to the inferred political orientation of their source publications.

## Dataset
The dataset, titled "All the News," was sourced from Kaggle and compiled by Andrew Thompson. It consists of 142,570 articles from various U.S. news outlets spanning from 2000 to 2016. Due to GitHub's file size constraints, the dataset is not uploaded here but can be accessed directly from Kaggle at the following link: [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/snapcrack/all-the-news/data)
